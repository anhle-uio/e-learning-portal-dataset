The procedures are therefore common to many specialties; the shared feature is the need to rapidly clarify and manage a potentially critical situation. This requires a prioritized, systematic approach and practiced skills.\n\nThe e-learning resource is built around the national requirements for practical skills for medical students in Norway adopted in 2015. Some resources will also be found under other subject areas, such as general practice, general surgery (traumatology), anesthesiology, and propedeutics.\n\nThe resources are intended as a supplement to regular teaching and textbooks.\n\nLearning outcomes: Support training and revision of the prioritized systematic approach and the practical skills necessary in the initial approach to acutely ill patients.\n\nPedagogy: Uses images, text, animations and interactive cases (“virtual patients”).\n\nUsed in: Teaching medical students at the University of Oslo.",

         "description": "The e-learning resource on the musculoskeletal system is intended as a supplement to the clinical teaching on the musculoskeletal system for medical students. On these pages you can both read and watch images/diagrams and videos that demonstrate how to examine the different joints. In addition, you will find patient histories and quizzes. The resource was developed during 2015–2018. The medical students Caroline Kooy Tveiten, Hannah Ugletveit Jahr and Alexander Øvestad produced texts, drawings and videos together with lecturers primarily within Orthopaedic Surgery at Oslo University Hospital, Orthopaedics Clinic (Elbow: Stein Tyrdal; Ankle/Foot: Are Stødle; Hand: Magne Røkkum; Shoulder: Berte Bøe; Hip: Lars Nordsletten; Knee: Lars Engebretsen), as well as Physical Medicine with Professor Jens Ivar Brox (Back and neck). Professor Lars Engebretsen was the academic lead for the project. Learning outcomes: Learn to perform correct joint examinations of patients with varying symptoms and trauma/disease. Learn to interpret examinations with pathological findings by comparing them with normal examinations. Teaching approach: The resource is structured as a reference work with a main emphasis on practical examination technique. Self-testing is included in the form of quizzes and virtual patients so that students can check their learning process. Useful in orthopaedics, physical medicine and rheumatology teaching, and as a supplement for later clinical work. Supplement to an orthopaedics textbook. Used in: Actively used in group teaching in modules 3 and 8, and as a supplement to lectures within the same topics. In module 3, students acquire basic knowledge about the musculoskeletal system’s normal structure and function and learn relevant examination methodology. Module 8 focuses mainly on pathology knowledge, using relevant examinations further in diagnostic work, and further treatment of the patient’s problem. Developed at: University of Oslo.",

The resource was developed during 2015–2018. The medical students Caroline Kooy Tveiten, Hannah Ugletveit Jahr and Alexander Øvestad produced texts, drawings and videos together with lecturers primarily within Orthopaedic Surgery at Oslo University Hospital, Orthopaedics Clinic (Elbow: Stein Tyrdal; Ankle/Foot: Are Stødle; Hand: Magne Røkkum; Shoulder: Berte Bøe; Hip: Lars Nordsletten; Knee: Lars Engebretsen), as well as Physical Medicine with Professor Jens Ivar Brox (Back and neck). Professor Lars Engebretsen was the academic lead for the project. Learning outcomes: Learn to perform correct joint examinations of patients with varying symptoms and trauma/disease. Learn to interpret examinations with pathological findings by comparing them with normal examinations. Teaching approach: The resource is structured as a reference work with a main emphasis on practical examination technique. Self-testing is included in the form of quizzes and virtual patients so that students can check their learning process. Useful in orthopaedics, physical medicine and rheumatology teaching, and as a supplement for later clinical work. Supplement to an orthopaedics textbook. Used in: Actively used in group teaching in modules 3 and 8, and as a supplement to lectures within the same topics. In module 3, students acquire basic knowledge about the musculoskeletal system’s normal structure and function and learn relevant examination methodology.

The e-learning resources are mostly produced in-house, but they also include a course in non-neoplastic renal pathology developed at the University of Bergen.\n\nLearning outcomes: The pages show e-learning resources that support the teaching provided. They include examples and descriptions of disease conditions that the student should be able to recognize.\n\nPedagogy: The pages contain digital slide sets, images of diseased organs shown during gross demonstrations, and videos showing a systematic examination and findings in diseased organs.\n\nUsed in: The digital slides are intended to be used both in teaching (microscopy courses) and for self-study, and are therefore organized in two formats: teaching cases and test cases. Images of gross specimens and videos can be used for self-study and revision.\n\nPrerequisites: Topics taught in Module 1 and 2 of the medical programme at the University of Oslo.\n\nExtra offer for especially interested students: The pages also include pointers to two courses developed for students particularly interested in kidney diseases and used on a completely voluntary basis. The system currently contains material for pathology courses at UiO (i.n.farstad@medisin.uio.no) and UiB (sabine.maria.leh@helse-bergen.no).\n\nThis e-learning resource was developed at: University of Oslo, University of Bergen",

It provides an introduction to basic history taking and examination (status presens), with hyperlinks to articles, images, videos, glossary explanations, and (eventually) quizzes. The target audience is Norwegian medical students in Norway and abroad, primarily early in their studies. However, there are also guides on examination techniques for more advanced learners, such as neurological examination and procedures like lumbar puncture, as well as corresponding advanced topics within other subject areas (some of which are under development). Subject areas: Internal medicine; Surgery/Orthopaedics; General practice; Neurology; Ophthalmology; ENT; Dermatology; Paediatrics (history taking and examination of children, infants and newborns); Psychiatry; Rheumatology. JournalWiki also includes a basic introduction to supplementary tests the clinician must be able to interpret independently as part of the clinical examination: Radiology (X-ray, CT, MRI, PET-CT, ultrasound, scintigraphy, etc.); Clinical biochemistry (interpretation of blood tests in various settings); Microscopy (urine, blood smear, etc.); Spirometry; ECG; and more. Work on JournalWiki has been led by Arne Westgaard at the Skills Centre at Rikshospitalet. Contributors so far have included students, fellows, clinicians, professors, and IT specialists at UiO. Contributors from other faculties are welcome. Students with good medical knowledge and above-average computing skills can complete a semester project or work for pay to further develop the resource.
